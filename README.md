# Expensia: A Personal Finance Management Application


## üìñ Project Overview

**Expensia** was created as a comprehensive project to enhance my development skills in a real-world environment. Over approximately **90 hours** of dedicated development time (tracked using time management tools), I focused extensively on refactoring and mastering Python's GUI frameworks, including Tkinter and its modern extension, CustomTkinter.

The refactoring process was primarily undertaken to achieve cleaner, more maintainable code while implementing proven design patterns for an overall superior project architecture. This endeavor rekindled my programming passion and reinforced the critical importance of thorough planning in application development. Even seemingly simple applications can encounter significant challenges without proper forethought. 

For a detailed development journey, please visit: **[Project Development Considerations](docs/development_path.md)**

While the application is fully functional, there's always room for improvement through additional testing and feature enhancements. However, I've decided to conclude this phase to explore other technologies and embark on new projects. Rest assured, any critical issues will be promptly addressed.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

| Technology | Purpose |
|------------|---------|
| **Python** | Core programming language for application development |
| **SQLite3** | Lightweight, local database engine for secure data management |
| **CSV Processing** | Built-in module for seamless data import/export functionality |
| **CustomTkinter** | Modern, customizable GUI framework for enhanced user interface |
| **Tkinter** | Native Python GUI toolkit providing foundational components |
| **JSON** | Configuration file format for theme and customization settings |



## üìö Comprehensive Documentation: A Good Project Starts with Its Documentation

While the application may not be perfect, I believe in thoroughly documenting every aspect of the development process. This documentation serves not only as a reference for the codebase but also chronicles the entire development journey, including challenges, design decisions, and key learnings that simulate a real-world development environment.

The documentation is structured to provide insights into both technical implementation and the development methodology, reflecting practices you'd encounter in professional software development.
