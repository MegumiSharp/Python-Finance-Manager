# Expensia: A Personal Finance management appliction

## A small introduction to the project
Created as a project to sharpen my skillset on a real work environment, i spent roughly 130 hours on the project, (counted with a time tracking application) most of the time was spent on refactoring and learn to use the gui of python tkinter and his exstension customtkinter. The refactoring was largly done to make a better looking code and use some design pattern to create a better overall project. 

This project helped me reawaken my rusty programmer skill, and teached me the importance to plan ahead an application like this, beacuse, no matter how simple an application could seem to be, if you do  not plan ahead a lot of problems could accour. For an in-depth path of development check here : [here](docs/development_path.md)

Even if the application is functional, is far from perfect, and could benefit from more testing about the features and some feature added, however i decided to stop here, because i want to keep learning other technology and work on some other projects, however if some issues accour in the tab i will fix it.

Even if in relativly small part, for this project i used, sqlite3, json and csv files, and python as primary language, with customtkinter and tkinter library for the gui.
