## Budget Management

During setup, you specified three percentages that form the foundation of the budget rule. This is a financial management method that helps track your finances using special tags.

<p align="center">
  <img src="user_guide_images/budget.png" alt="Budget view" />

  <em>Preview of Budget view</em>
</p>


### The Budget Rule

For example, with a â‚¬2,000 monthly income:
- **50% for Needs**: Essential expenses (bills, food, utilities)
- **30% for Wants**: Non-essential purchases (entertainment, dining out, hobbies)
- **20% for Savings**: Emergency fund and future expenses

### Key Features:
- Percentages can be modified in `data/user_settings/user_settings.json` or during initial setup
- Budget displays current month data and resets monthly
- Savings bar fills automatically when salary is detected
- Real-time budget updates when transactions are saved

### Budget Tags (Case Sensitive):
- **"Salary"**: Monthly income (required for budget calculations)
- **"Needs"**: Essential expenses (deducted from needs budget)
- **"Wants"**: Non-essential expenses (deducted from wants budget)
- **"Saving"**: Savings transactions (deducted from savings budget)

### Budget Behavior:
- Overspending in needs or wants categories is automatically deducted from savings
- Unused funds from needs and wants become additional savings
- Budget resets on the 1st of each month
- Requires salary entry to activate monthly budget calculations

**Important**: Import **replaces** the entire transaction table. To add multiple transactions, export current data, modify the CSV file, and re-import.

### Export Function

#### Restore Backup
