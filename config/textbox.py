A smart way to help you track your expenses — Budget Rule

What is a Budget Rule? A Budget Rule helps you organize your spending by dividing your transactions into 3 simple labels:

1. Needs – Essentials like rent, food, and bills
2. Wants – Non-essentials like eating out or games
3. Savings – Money you set aside for the future or to pay off debt (calculated automatically)

You choose how much of your total income goes into each label. 50% for Needs, 30% for Wants, 20% for Savings

This is how it works:

• In the tag menu you can choose which tags are considered Wants and which are Needs. The Savings label is calculated by default based on what's left. 
• When you use the special built-in tag "Income", the app will divide that amount using your chosen percentages and apply it to your Budget Rule.
• By clicking Budget Rule in the sidebar, a dedicated tab opens where you can see how much you've spent in each label and when.

The app compares your spending with your rules and alerts you if you're going over in any area. 
You can stick to the classic 50/30/20 split or adjust the percentages to match your lifestyle.
